|---|---|---|
| [K-Means Clustering Foundations](https://github.com/sellingjaguar/Foundations-of-Data-Science-K-Means-Clustering-in-Python) | Python, Jupyter, SKLearn, Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib | My work for the free course material on the "K-Means Clustering in Python" by the University of London in the Coursera Platform where I learned the logic behind the K-means CLustering Algorithm and gotten an idea of how other Data Clustering algorithms operate. |
| [The Data Science Course: Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2024](https://github.com/sellingjaguar/The-Data-Science-Course-Complete-Data-Science-Bootcamp-2024) | Combinatorics, Bayesian Inferences | In-progress |
<!--- Might not leave a good impression altough the idea is solid
| [World penis data analysis](https://github.com/sellingjaguar/Penis-analysis) | Python, Jupyter, Pandas, MatPlotLib | In this project I wanted to mainly verify if there was inflation on size when the subjects were asked to self-report their size compared against when they were measured by a professional. |
